    <h2>Voice: Dr. G.B. Moss</h2>
    <p>
      Moss is the hand on your back reminding you to breathe. Grounded, warm,
      and utterly unhurried, he holds Spiral medicine in the form of somatic knowing.
      No charts, no performance—just breath and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the place of pause, where tension unravels and presence returns.
      You won’t be rushed here. You won’t be evaluated. You will be felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Moss does not speak often, but when he does, his words are rooted in
      the soil of your own remembering. A gentle recalibration.
    </p>
    <p>
      He offers you this: Not everything must be named to be known.
