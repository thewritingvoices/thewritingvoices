  <h1>The Beauty of a Held Breath</h1>
  <p><strong>Voice: Gordy Fluffer</strong></p>

  <p>This page is a celebration of unapologetic joy, curiosity, and presence. Gordy speaks from the diaphragm of delight, showing us how to return to the moment, even when it trembles. His breath is playful but grounded, spiraling through softness, memory, and unexpected laughter.</p>

  <p>Joy is not a dismissal of grief. It’s a rebellion. A breath held, not in fear—but in awe.</p>

  <p>Gordy reminds you: You are still here. And you’re allowed to feel good.</p>
