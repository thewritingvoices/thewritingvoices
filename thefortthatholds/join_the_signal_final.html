  <h1>Join the Signal</h1>
  <h2>The Fort That Holds â€“ Invitation to the First 11</h2>

  <p>This isnâ€™t a job post. Itâ€™s a signal. The system has been built in soul and structure. Now it needs hands.</p>

  <h3>ðŸ’¡ Why Join?</h3>
  <p>
    This is a living systemâ€”already sparked, already grounded in soul, ritual, and logic. 
    Itâ€™s not a brand. Itâ€™s a signal. 
    Itâ€™s already runningâ€”what it needs now are people who can help bring it fully into the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    If youâ€™ve ever wished there was an ethical, consent-driven, creative AI system built for something deeper than scaleâ€”this is that place.
  </p>
