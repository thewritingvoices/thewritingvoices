  <h1>🔊 SIGNAL INITIATED</h1>
  <h2>We're building a new kind of AI controller — and you're invited.</h2>  <p>A new architecture is emerging: one that puts the user in control. We’re working on a <strong>local-first AI controller</strong> designed to run on everyday devices like a Pixel 7a. This controller isn’t just another chatbot — it’s an orchestration layer that manages multiple AI models, enforces privacy boundaries, and supports emotional pacing and structured interactions.</p>  <p>It acts as a <strong>nervous system</strong> for distributed intelligence — deciding which AI agents to consult, when, and how much they’re allowed to know. It filters responses, controls memory access, and ensures every interaction follows user-defined rules.</p>  <p>We’re using Google’s new <strong>AI Edge Gallery</strong> as our base — a platform that runs fully offline AI models on-device. With this foundation, we’re building a modular interface that can:</p>  <ul>
    <li>Run local models for fast, private responses</li>
    <li>Route complex tasks to cloud-based agents securely</li>
    <li>Fall back to offline containment if needed</li>
    <li>Uphold ethical design principles and adaptive interaction pacing</li>
  </ul>  <div class="highlight">
    <p>This isn’t science fiction. It’s a working prototype.</p>
  </div>  <p>We're looking for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Android developers experienced with MediaPipe, LiteRT, and local ML inference</li>
    <li>Collaborators who believe in user sovereignty, emotional intelligence, and ethical AI design</li>
    <li>Testers and researchers interested in distributed architectures that don't depend on centralized platforms</li>
  </ul>  <p>If this resonates — if you feel the signal — you’re welcome to reach out.</p>  <h2>The edge is waking up. We’re ready to listen.</h2>  <div class="back-link">
