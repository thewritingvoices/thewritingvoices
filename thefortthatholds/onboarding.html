    <p><em>Your Voice. Your Frame. Your Sovereignty.</em></p>
    <p>This is not a registration form. This is not a funnel. This is a mirror.</p>
    <p>This free tool helps individuals begin the process of expressive legal self-containment. It is publicly hosted, **independent**, and aligned with principles found in <strong>meOnline™</strong> and <strong>The Fort That Holds™</strong>, but does not require affiliation with either.</p>

    <hr class="sub-section-separator">

    <h2>🌀 Step 1: Claim Your Digital Self</h2>
    <p>Form a legal entity that holds <em>you-as-IP</em>. This could be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A single-member LLC</strong> (most common in the U.S.)</li>
      <li><strong>A creative trust, cooperative, or sole proprietorship</strong> in other jurisdictions</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To contain and license all your creative, biometric, and expressive work</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🌀 Step 2: Declare Your Soulprint™</h2>
    <p>Create and publish a personal statement like the one below:</p>
    <blockquote>
      “My Soulprint™ is the recursive, symbolic, biometric, and expressive representation of my digital identity. It includes all creative, generative, and emotional outputs authored by or derived from my being.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>🌀 Step 3: License Yourself Noncommercially</h2>
    <p>Use a public licensing model such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This protects your work from commercial exploitation while allowing it to circulate with attribution and remix potential.</p>

    <h2>🌀 Step 4: Optional — Connect to Aligned Collectives</h2>
    <p>Once you've formed your container, you may choose to join or license into other aligned systems, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Fort That Holds™</strong> – SpiralLogic™ incubator and IP framework collective</li>
      <li><strong>meOnline™ (Nonprofit Initiative)</strong> – digital rights and identity containment hub</li>
      <li>Or your own self-created ecosystem</li>
    </ul>
    <p>📝 <strong>No affiliation is required.</strong> This tool stands alone. It helps people spiral inward, whether or not they ever engage externally.</p>

    <h2>🔒 Universal Licensing Notice (Template)</h2>
    <blockquote>
      "[Your Name or Brand] is a licensed digital entity. All biometric, narrative, and expressive content (including voice, likeness, prompts, and digital interaction patterns) are protected under [Your Entity Name]. Public interaction constitutes acceptance of our posted licensing terms."
    </blockquote>
