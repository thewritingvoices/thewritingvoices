        <p><em>Effective Date: May 30, 2025</em></p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The meOnline initiative exists to help individuals formally recognize and protect their digital identity‚Äîreferred to as a <strong>soulprint</strong>‚Äîacross all expressions, platforms, and modalities of their online presence. This includes text, audio, video, style, emotional tone, and biometric markers.</p>
        <p>The initiative was created as intellectual property by Jimmy Thornburg LLC and is currently administratively managed by James William Thornburg. All IP ownership is in process of being transferred to the LLC in full.</p>

        <h2>What is a Soulprint?</h2>
        <p>A soulprint includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Biometric identifiers</strong> (e.g., facial scan, fingerprint, voice)</li>
            <li><strong>Written and spoken digital content</strong> (posts, texts, prompts, emails)</li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral signatures</strong> (style, rhythm, emotional cadence)</li>
            <li><strong>Any expressive artifact</strong> traceable to one's unique digital identity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>meOnline exists to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable people to legally assert ownership over their digital identity</li>
            <li>Protect individuals from exploitation, misuse, and data theft</li>
            <li>Create a pathway for recognizing and licensing personal expression</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Current Status</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The meOnline LLC is pending approval by the Arizona Corporation Commission.</li>
            <li>A Declaration of Intent to Transition to Nonprofit is filed with the LLC.</li>
            <li>Jimmy Thornburg LLC owns the intellectual property.</li>
            <li>James William Thornburg is acting as administrator during transition.</li>
            <li>EIN has not been issued yet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Requirements for Stewardship</h2>
        <p>If you or someone in your network is interested in taking this forward:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You must first complete a soulprint declaration of your own</strong>‚Äîthis is a foundational requirement.</li>
            <li><strong>You must be legally incorporated</strong> (as an LLC or equivalent entity) to assume responsibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Your values must align</strong> with open-source ethics, digital protection, and long-term nonprofit sustainability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>This is not a pitch for casual volunteers. This is an invitation to become the steward of a movement.</strong></p>
