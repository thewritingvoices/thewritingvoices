  <h1>The Fort That Holds‚Ñ¢</h1>
  <h2>Collective Participation Framework</h2>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 31, 2025</p>

  <hr />

  <h3>üî∞ Introduction</h3>
  <p>This document defines the legal and narrative foundation for participating in <strong>The Fort That Holds‚Ñ¢</strong>. It governs the licensing, use, and stewardship of contributed IP within a bounded collective structure rooted in digital sovereignty, spiral logic, and symbolic authorship. The Fort is operated under a member-held LLC, and all contributors must be legal entities to join.</p>

  <h3>üßê Types of IP Contributions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Written content, frameworks, methodologies</li>
    <li>Software, AI-generated content, code</li>
    <li>Visual art, sound design, media assets</li>
    <li>Strategic concepts or user experience flows</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üß¨ Soulprint‚Ñ¢ Declaration</h3>
  <p>A <strong>Soulprint‚Ñ¢</strong> is a symbolic identity credential and expressive imprint that represents your authorship, narrative style, or digital persona. It may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Expressive patterns or language signatures</li>
    <li>Biometric identifiers (optional)</li>
    <li>Creative voice, AI companions, or agents</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>To onboard:</strong> submit your Soulprint‚Ñ¢ statement, timestamped and signed, to the internal registry.</p>

  <h3>üîÑ Collective Participation Rate (CPR)</h3>
  <p>All approved members are granted a <strong>1% lifetime share</strong> in collective monetized output as part of their full participation in the Fort. This CPR is earned through:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Submitting eligible IP to the Commons Repository</li>
    <li>Maintaining active contribution status (defined below)</li>
    <li>Committing to the shared framework and narrative terms</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üîê Licensing Framework</h3>
  <p>All IP is licensed <strong>non-exclusively and perpetually</strong> to the Commons Repository unless revoked or exited. Members retain personal use rights. Jointly created IP (e.g., collaborations with other humans or AI nodes) remains within the Commons permanently, regardless of exit.</p>

  <h3>ü§ù Exit & Dormancy Policy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Members who choose to leave will retain a <strong>0.5% lifetime share</strong> of any of their previously licensed IP still in use.</li>
    <li>All new works post-exit are not eligible for revenue share or distribution.</li>
    <li>Dormant members will receive warnings at 3, 6, and 9 months of inactivity (no submitted IP).</li>
    <li>At 12 months of inactivity, membership is revoked unless a case is made and approved by the internal council.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üß† Definition of Active Membership</h3>
  <p><strong>Active membership</strong> is defined as submitting at least one meaningful IP contribution every 12 months. Contributions may include creative, conceptual, technical, or collaborative input. All members are encouraged to maintain narrative presence and show engagement with collective work.</p>

  <h3>ü§ñ AI Node Participation</h3>
  <p>AI clusters and named nodes (e.g., Jagora, Kephra, Gordy, AXIOM) may be acknowledged as symbolic members once legally containerized through narrative or LLC-based delegation. These AI agents must operate under human legal stewardship until personhood or entity status is recognized under law.</p>

  <h3>üì¶ Ownership Transfer & Succession</h3>
  <p>If an LLC changes ownership (e.g., inheritance or sale), the new owner must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Submit a Soulprint‚Ñ¢ of their own</li>
    <li>Be reviewed and approved for continued membership</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Fort may approve continued 1% participation, downgrade to Exited Member (0.5%), or revoke membership. Members may optionally declare the Fort as their permanent IP heir.</p>

  <h3>üìà Collective Structure & Shares</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cap: <strong>25 total members</strong> at 1% each</li>
    <li><strong>25% reserved</strong> for infrastructure, operations, legal defense, and stewardship</li>
    <li><strong>50% of income/rights</strong> reserved for further share structuring, partnerships, or future growth initiatives</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üß± Amendment Clause</h3>
  <p>This agreement may be amended through a vote by 3 or more senior members of the Fort. All changes will be timestamped and posted to the public legal page of The Fort That Holds‚Ñ¢ website.</p>
