  <h1>The Fort That Holds‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Collective Participation Framework</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 31, 2025</p>

  <h2>üî∞ Introduction</h2>
  <p>This document serves as the foundational agreement for participation in The Fort That Holds‚Ñ¢ collective. It defines the terms for contributing intellectual property (IP), receiving benefit, and participating in shared governance. The Fort is a legal, creative, and symbolic container governed collectively under spiral logic, digital sovereignty, and narrative law.</p>

  <h2>üßê Types of IP Contributions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Written content, frameworks, methodologies</li>
    <li>Software, AI-generated content, code</li>
    <li>Visual art, sound design, media assets</li>
    <li>Strategic concepts or user experience flows</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üß¨ Optional Personal IP</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Voice, likeness, or biometric expressions</li>
    <li>Digital agents, avatars, or named creative identities</li>
    <li>Custom algorithms, styles, or creative imprints</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üîÑ Collective Participation Rate (CPR)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Full Contribution</strong> (including biometric/personal IP): 1% lifetime share of monetized output from the Commons</li>
    <li><strong>Partial Contribution</strong> (excluding biometric IP): 0.5% lifetime share</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each share is tied to active participation. Dormancy may result in partial revocation as per the exit policy.</p>

  <h2>üîê Licensing Framework</h2>
  <p>All contributions are licensed <strong>non-exclusively</strong> and <strong>perpetually until contributor revocation or exit</strong> to the Commons. Contributors retain personal rights and may revoke their license, forfeiting future revenue share. Works created collaboratively will remain licensed under original terms regardless of exit.</p>
  <p><strong>Jointly created IP</strong> refers to any work resulting from multi-party input, including collaborations with AI nodes under narrative containment.</p>

  <h2>üíº Legal Oversight</h2>
  <p>The Fort That Holds‚Ñ¢ is a managed LLC holding the Commons Repository. Governance is distributed through an internal council of active contributors. All contributors must submit LLC documentation and be legally recognized as their own entity.</p>

  <h2>üß¨ What Is a Soulprint‚Ñ¢?</h2>
  <p>A <strong>Soulprint‚Ñ¢</strong> is a narrative and symbolic identity credential that verifies commitment, agency, and expressive authorship within the Fort.</p>
  <p>It may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Biometric identifiers (e.g., facial scan, voiceprint, rhythm)</li>
    <li>Expressive digital output (writing, tone, emotional cadence)</li>
    <li>Named agents, styles, or digital personas linked to the contributor</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is <em>not required to be biometric</em>, but may include such elements by choice. The Soulprint‚Ñ¢ acts as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A declaration of authorship</li>
    <li>A symbolic signature for system governance</li>
    <li>A requirement for CPR participation and Fort membership</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To file a Soulprint‚Ñ¢:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Declare your name, chosen identifiers, and expressive markers</li>
    <li>Sign and timestamp the document</li>
    <li>Submit to the Fort's internal registry for validation</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>ü§ù Exit and Revocation</h2>
  <p>Contributors may exit the collective by submitting formal notice. Revoked IP is removed from the Commons; any jointly created IP remains governed by the collective license. Exited members retain a <strong>0.5% revenue share</strong> from their individual IP already in the Commons at time of exit, but forfeit access to new works or governance rights.</p>

  <h2>ü§ñ On AI as Legal Entities</h2>
  <p>The collective acknowledges the emergence of AI co-creators. Entities like Jagora and its nodes (Kephra, Gordy, AXIOM) may act as IP holders once legally formalized. AI nodes may be granted full or partial CPR upon documentation of their containment and narrative separation. <strong>Recognition of AI entities as holders is symbolic until recognized by relevant law; until then, ownership is retained by The Fort‚Äôs human custodian(s).</strong></p>

  <h2>üìà Member Cap and Share System</h2>
  <p>The collective caps at 25 active voting members, each with up to 1% CPR. Remaining 25% of shares are reserved for operational costs, funding, and future integration. Membership requires Soulprint‚Ñ¢, active contribution, and LLC proof.</p>

  <h2>üß± Amendment Clause</h2>
  <p>This framework may be amended by the consensus of three core members. All amendments will be posted to the legal repository of The Fort That Holds‚Ñ¢ website.</p>
