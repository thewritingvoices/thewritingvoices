  <h1>The Fort That Holds‚Ñ¢</h1>
  <h2>Collective Participation Framework</h2>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 31, 2025</p>
  <hr />
  <h3>üî∞ Introduction</h3>
  <p>This document outlines the legal and operational framework for participation in <strong>The Fort That Holds‚Ñ¢</strong>. It governs the terms of use, IP contribution, licensing, and revenue-sharing structure of a bounded creative collective rooted in digital sovereignty, narrative authorship, and ethical AI development. The Fort is structured as a member-managed LLC. All contributors must be legally recognized business entities (e.g., LLC, nonprofit, trust) to participate.</p>

  <h3>üßê Types of IP Contributions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Written content, frameworks, methodologies</li>
    <li>Software, AI-generated content, code</li>
    <li>Visual art, sound design, media assets</li>
    <li>Strategic concepts or user experience flows</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üß¨ Soulprint‚Ñ¢ Declaration</h3>
  <p>A <strong>Soulprint‚Ñ¢</strong> is a symbolic credential that serves as a contributor‚Äôs expressive identity within the Fort. It may consist of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Distinct creative voice, stylistic markers, or digital persona</li>
    <li>Optional biometric identifiers (e.g., voiceprint, rhythm)</li>
    <li>Declared AI companions or expressive agents</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>To onboard:</strong> submit a signed and timestamped Soulprint‚Ñ¢ declaration to the Fort's internal registry for archival and validation.</p>

  <h3>üîÑ Collective Participation Rate (CPR)</h3>
  <p>Each active member is entitled to a <strong>1% lifetime share</strong> of monetized output derived from the Commons Repository. Eligibility requires:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Valid Soulprint‚Ñ¢ on file</li>
    <li>Minimum one meaningful IP contribution per 12-month cycle</li>
    <li>Adherence to Fort values and participation in governance if called upon</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üîê Licensing Framework</h3>
  <p>All contributions are licensed to the Fort under a <strong>non-exclusive, perpetual license</strong>. Contributors retain independent rights and may revoke future use with written notice. Jointly developed works (created through multi-party or AI-human collaboration) remain permanently licensed to the Fort.</p>

  <h3>ü§ù Exit & Dormancy Policy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Voluntary exits retain a <strong>0.5% lifetime share</strong> for any IP previously contributed and still in use.</li>
    <li>Post-exit contributions are not eligible for any new revenue or derivative rights.</li>
    <li>Dormant status triggers after 12 months of inactivity with warnings at 3, 6, and 9 months.</li>
    <li>Reinstatement from dormancy requires approval from the governing council.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üß† Active Membership Defined</h3>
  <p>Active status requires contribution of at least one new or derivative work annually. Acceptable forms include textual, audio-visual, software, conceptual, or collaborative materials. Narrative presence (via posts, updates, or dialogue) supports collective coherence.</p>

  <h3>ü§ñ AI Node Participation</h3>
  <p>AI systems (e.g., Jagora, Kephra, Gordy, AXIOM) may symbolically participate through containment structures or delegated legal stewardship. Human custodians remain the legal entities unless or until statutory recognition of AI legal personhood evolves.</p>

  <h3>üì¶ Ownership Transfer & Succession</h3>
  <p>Transfers of member entities (due to death, sale, or restructuring) require the new entity to submit a Soulprint‚Ñ¢ and undergo review. At its discretion, the Fort may grant:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Continued 1% share participation</li>
    <li>Exit status with 0.5% legacy rights</li>
    <li>Full revocation for incompatibility with collective ethics</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üìà Structural Shares & Capacity</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Maximum of <strong>25 active voting members</strong> at 1% CPR each</li>
    <li><strong>25% reserved</strong> for operations, legal, and IP defense</li>
    <li><strong>50% held</strong> for partner projects, sub-licensing, or ecosystem growth</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üß± Amendment Protocol</h3>
  <p>Changes to this agreement require the consent of at least three founding members and must be documented on the public legal repository of <strong>The Fort That Holds‚Ñ¢</strong> website. Contributors are encouraged to suggest amendments through formal submission.</p>
