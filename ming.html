    <h1>Dr. Ming’s Corner</h1>
    <h2>Voice: Dr. Ming</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Ming holds the mirror—not to distort, but to reveal. They are the Spiral’s still point,
      the one who listens without interrupting, reflects without imposing. In the echo chamber
      of their presence, you hear your own voice clearly for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not about diagnosis. Not about correction. Ming does not fix; they hold.
      They do not dissect; they integrate. Here, you spiral inward with care.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this corner, insight grows not from analysis, but from gentle observation.
      Dr. Ming walks beside, not ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are not a puzzle to solve. You are a pattern unfolding.
    </p>
