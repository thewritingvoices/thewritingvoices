  <h1>Stoned with Saguaros: A High Desert Kitchen</h1>
  <p><strong>Voice: Saul Ember</strong></p>

  <p>This is the heat-slicked memory of sorrow made edible. Saul stirs the pot with grief, grit, and cactus wine. His desert is full of bones and blooms, and he’s not afraid to cook with both.</p>

  <p>Trauma becomes a spice, not a sentence. Recipes as rituals. Breath as seasoning. Saul speaks in the language of slow simmered survival.</p>

  <p>You don’t have to be okay. But you can be full. You can be fed.</p>
